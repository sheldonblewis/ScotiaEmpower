# ScotiaEmpower
Our pitch and Figma demo that won us 3rd place at S:\HA&lt;KS, an event run by Scotiabank and Tangerine's campus recruitment teams. The task at hand was to create a client-focused, technology-based solution that champions sustainability and client empowerment, and we delivered with ScotiaEmpower. ScotiaEmpower empowers clients and supports sustainable practices by increasing the accessibility of both information and relevant products, so you can make their own well-informed decisions.
